# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment

By Daniel Chima

This is a repo for the course's assignment project.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The source data for this project can be found at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

To use this script, you have to set your working directory to the folder that includes all the datasets. In this case, the extracted UCI HAR Datset folder.
After that, it is pretty much straightforward to follow. The script is well commented.


The course instructions for completing the project were:
    Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
